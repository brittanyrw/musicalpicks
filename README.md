## Summary

There are hundreds of musical movies for users to discover. This app helps users narrow down their choices based on their personal preferences. Users take a short quiz that will determine the genre they are most interested in. Based on the user quiz responses, recommendations for movie musicals will be displayed after the quiz has been completed. The results include images of the musical movie poster and a link to The Movie Database information page, which includes plot summaries, images, ratings and more, for each movie. Users also have the option to search for movies by genre to view additional recommendations.
